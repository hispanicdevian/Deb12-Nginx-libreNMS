## This guide is created using Proxmox as a type-1 hypervisor + Debian 12 LXE(Container) or VM(Virtual Machine)

- Donload Proxmox Virtual Environment from the Official website: https://www.proxmox.com/en/
- Create a bootable image with the ISO (avoid using ventoy, as of Jan/2024 it doesnt work properly.)
- Boot into your bootable device and start installation
